# National Pokedex App

National Pokedex is a Pokedex app where all Pokemon data is fetched from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) via third party Swift Wrapper Library called [PokemonAPI](https://github.com/kinkofer/PokemonAPI).
Fetched Pokemons and their sprites are displayed in a list. The user can search (using search bar), add Pokemon to Favourites as well as display more data about each Pokemon on another screen by simply tapping the cell of the desired Pokemon.
